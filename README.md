The goal of this project is to practice using Javascript, and React for web development. I created a and styled a product card that displays a product with it's images, name, and price.

##What I learned:
Learned how to combine arrow functions and the map function to effectively iterate through and array.
Example: In App.jsx the arrow function was passed through the map function to display each Product Card.

Learned how to combine HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a Product Card.
Example: Craeted a function in ProductCard.jsx that takes in a product object and destructers it into its propterties. This allowed me to pass those properties into HTML. This allows me to display products dynamically. Using ClassNames, I was able to section off different parts of HTML to effectevly select those parts with CSS. This allows me to style the product card.

Learned how to use Flexbox to style and design the Product Card.
Example: In App.css and ProductCard.css, Flexbox was used to create the layout of the Product Card.

Learned how to create a Dark Mode theme using states in react. This taught me how to
Example: App.jsx, using state I was able to change the theme of the Product Card by using a button.

##Things I struggled with:
My biggest struggle was styling the Product Card with CSS. I struggled to effectively use Flexbox to create a layout that I wanted. What I did to overcome this was understanding the properties that Flexbox uses and how those worked.

Another issue I had was coming up with a design that displayed the Product Card. To overcome this issue, I looked at different websites and how used their designs for inspiration. For my design I tried to recreate how Amazon displays their products when you search for an item. I also used a color palette generator that I found online to color the Product Card.
